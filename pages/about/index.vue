          <p>My name is David Emrich, and I am a Creative Designer and Developer currently placed in the Oklahoma City area.
            Graduating from the State University of New York at New Paltz, I currently hold a Bachelors in Visual Arts with
            a strong concentration in Graphic Design. My interest in design stems back from my childhood before I even knew
            this was a plausible way to earn an income, making webpages and logos before I even had an internet connection.
            Since then I have learned various languages and frameworks, while always willing and expecting to learn more.</p>

          <p>Since my graduation in 2013, I've helped mutiple companies and charities better themselves through the help of
            creative collaboration. From small, startup companies to high end, multi-million dollar firms, I help contribute
            in a way that's unique to my skill set; expanding each company to new horizons with the influential powers of
            design and development.</p>
